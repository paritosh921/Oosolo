================================================================================SOURCE: Exciting Advances In Quantum Computers To Expect In 2025 (https://quantumzeitgeist.com/2025-guide-to-quantum-computers/)

The year 2024 was an interesting year for Quantum Technology and for the world at large. Among the themes we discuss, a couple of notable areas are changing the investment landscape of quantum computers. One area is retail investing in quantum computing. Another is the technological push for logical qubits. Investors, especially retail investors, are now aware of quantum computing. There is no doubt in our minds  the visibility regarding allied quantum technologies. You may argue that we have been here before with several rounds of prior excitement. Still, we think it is different this time. We have seen steady capital inflows into some of the popular pure-play quantum computing companies. These include IonQ, Rigetti, and D-Wave. Inevesting $1000 into an equal weighting of each of these stocks (IonQ, Rigetti, and D-Wave) that’s $333.33 for each company initially. You’d have approximately $552.32 return from RGTI, $1135.66 from D-Wave, and $857.66 from IonQ. That gives a total of $2545....

SOURCE: Quantum computing’s six most important trends for 2025 (https://www.moodys.com/web/en/us/insights/quantum/quantum-computings-six-most-important-trends-for-2025.html)

The financial industry is anticipated to become one of the earliest adopters of commercially useful quantum computing technologies. These technologies are expected to become available within the next few years, making it more important than ever to follow experimental developments. Therefore, as 2024 comes to a close, we pause to reflect upon what has recently transpired and look for trends we believe will continue through 2025 and beyond. This exercise has led to the identification of six trends, each of which we cover through 2024 reports and announcements: These trends are not ordered by significance or likelihood; we see all of these as equally likely. In “The road to useful quantum computing,” published on February 13, 2024, we reviewed the events of 2023 that started shifting our conversations from physical qubits in 2022 to logical qubits in 2024. Whereas a “physical qubit” refers to actual error-prone hardware, a “logical qubit” is an arrangement of these physical qubits that e...

SOURCE: Quantum Computing Trends and Predictions 2025 From Industry Insiders (https://www.itprotoday.com/high-performance-computing/quantum-computing-trends-and-predictions-2025-from-industry-insiders)

IT leaders and industry insiders share their quantum computing trends and predictions for 2025. How significant will quantum computing be in 2025? Judging by the surge in predictions submitted to ITPro Today — just three for 2024 compared with 28 for 2025 — it's clear that quantum computing is set to receive much greater attention this year. Industry leaders anticipate that 2025 will be a pivotal year for quantum computing, as advancements in post-quantum cryptography, error correction, and AI integration transform cybersecurity and innovation. These developments are pushing organizations to future-proof their infrastructures for the emerging Quantum Age, especially as we approach the much-discussed Q-Day — the moment when quantum computers could render current cryptographic methods obsolete. However, not everyone agrees with the notion that Q-Day is imminent. ITPro Today tech expert Christopher Tozzi argues that quantum computers remain too unreliable for widespread, practical use, su...

Dive into the details to explore how these advancements are shaping the future. Microsoft's Majorana 1 chip marks a leap forward in quantum computing. Introduced in early 2025, this processor features Microsoft's new Topological Core architecture, built with eight topological qubits [4][5]. At its core is a specialized topoconductor that manipulates Majorana particles - quasi-particles acting like "half-electrons" known for their strong resistance to errors [8]. This design addresses key scalability challenges in quantum computing. The Maj...

Editor’s Note: In late fall 2024, we asked for contributions on predictions for the quantum industry in the coming year. What follows is a curated list of just some of those experts who submitted their key insights and emerging trends that may shape quantum computing and quantum information science for 2025. Steve Brierley, founder and CEO of Riverlane Key trends in quantum technology in 2025: In 2025, we predict diamond technology will become an increasing part of overall industry conversation as more companies realize the potential of using diamond-based quantum systems in data centers and edge applications. The chief advantage to diamond technology is that it allows for room-temperature quantum computing, without the need for large mainframes. It also eliminates the need for absolute zero temperature and complex laser systems. As such, diamond technology allows for smaller, portable quantum devices that can be used in all sorts of locations and environments, ultimately bringing us c...
